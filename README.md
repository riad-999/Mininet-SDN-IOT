## Emulating an IOT Network that is based on an SDN Network
this project was realised during my bachelors degree studies, it consist of emulating an IOT network that is based on an SDN, and measuring the the Network Performance of the IOT Devices communication protocole 6LOWPAN using 4 parameters: 
<ul>
    <li>Bit rate </li>
    <li>Latency </li>
    <li>Jitter</li>
    <li>Packet Loss</li>
</ul>
this project helped me learn new things: 
<ul>
    <li>i got introduced to the technology of SDN, the benefit of sotwarization of networks and the separation of the physical and the application layer</li>
    <li>inderstand the limitation of IOT devices and the requirement of new efficient network protocols</li>
    <li>hands on experience with mininet, ONOS Controller, Iperf (performance measuring tool), Python network programning</li>
</ul>
